# 🏗️ MyFraction_Backend

This is the backend for **MyFraction** — a highly scalable, blockchain-powered platform enabling **Fractional Ownership of Real Estate**.

It supports a full ecosystem for buying, managing, and reselling real estate ownership shares — with all transactions immutably recorded on the blockchain and a secondary market for peer-to-peer trading.

## 🚀 Features

- 🏠 **Fractional Ownership Engine** — secure handling of property shares across multiple investors
- 🔗 **Blockchain Integration** — all ownership records and transactions are recorded on-chain for transparency and trust
- 🔁 **Secondary Market** — investors can list and sell their ownership fractions to other users
- ⚙️ **Node.js + Express** — clean and modular RESTful API structure
- 🗃️ **MongoDB** — document-based storage for properties, users, and off-chain metadata
- 📡 **WebSockets + Redis Pub/Sub** — real-time updates on transactions, property listings, and job status
- 🧠 **Redis + BullMQ** — powerful job queue handling with:
  - Fallback Queues
  - Retry Mechanism
  - Delayed & Scheduled Tasks
- 📊 **BullBoard Integration** — queue monitoring with visual UI
- 🔐 **Secure Auth** — JWT-based authentication and role management (WIP)
- 🧪 **Modular Codebase** — ready for scaling and plug-and-play feature extensions

## 🔗 Blockchain-Powered Ownership

- Each investment, transfer, or sale is **recorded on the blockchain**, ensuring tamper-proof ownership history.
- Smart contracts handle:
  - Fraction allocation
  - Investment confirmation
  - Ownership transfers
  - Event emissions to backend
- The backend listens for on-chain events and updates user portfolios in real time.

## 🔁 Secondary Market

- Users can **list their ownership fractions** for sale.
- Other users can **buy listed shares**, enabling liquidity in real estate investments.
- Ownership transfers are recorded on-chain via smart contract calls.
